#Blackjack-Coffee

This is an automated copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from the [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum.  For technical reasons, the history has been omitted, and my code is mixed with that of my pair and the exercise's starting point.  As such, this repo is representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled, but not of my solo work.  For a better perspective on my own work, see [Hive](https://github.com/Whoaa512/Hive).
